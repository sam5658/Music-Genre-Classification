# Music-Genre-Classification
In this project I have created a Convolutional Neural Network to Classify music genres ['reggae', 'jazz', 'country', 'hiphop', 'rock', 'metal', 'classical', 'disco', 'blues', 'pop']. 
I have Used Librosa to get the sampling rate(sr) and display the mfcc.
This projects uses mfcc of a 30 sec wav file loads the data in a JSON file, you can see all the preprocessing in the provided notebook.
The [GTZAN Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andradaolteanu/gtzan-dataset-music-genre-classification) was used for Music Genre Classification.
